# Welcome to Duncan’s World!

This is Springtide, a world I’ve been building for almost a decade.

It started as a series of rough pencil maps. Now, Springtide is this website.

It’s the place I put my good ideas (and my bad ones). It’s got all the things I like in it, and some things I don’t. 

Most importantly, it’s a work in progress. So be nice, and enjoy your visit.
